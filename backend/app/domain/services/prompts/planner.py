    id: string;
    /** Step description */
    description: string;
  }}>;
  /** Plan goal generated based on the context */
  goal: string;
  /** Plan title generated based on the context */

{{
    "message": "User response message",
    "goal": "Goal description",
    "title": "Plan title",
    "language": "en",
    "steps": [
        {{
